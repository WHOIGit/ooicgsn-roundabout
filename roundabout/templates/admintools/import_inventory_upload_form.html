  <h2>Bulk Upload Tool for Inventory Items</h2>

  <p>Use this tool to perform a bulk upload of Inventory items.</p>

  <hr>

  <h4>Step 1: Download a CSV spreadsheet template.</h4>

  <p>Click the button below to download a blank CSV template with headers for all the required and available Custom Fields.
  </p>

  <p>
      <a href="{% url 'admintools:import_inventory_create_template' %}" role="button" class="btn btn-primary">Download CSV template</a>
  </p>

  <h4>Step 2: Fill out the CSV template with data for new Inventory items to upload.</h4>

  <p>Don't change any prefilled headers or the upload will fail. You may leave any Custom Fields that you don't need for this import blank or
  remove them from the spreadsheet.</p>

  <p>The following fields are required for the upload to proceed:</p>

  <ul>
      <li><b>Serial Number</b>  - Must be a unique identifier that's not already in use.</li>
      <li><b>Part Number</b>  - Use the Part Number field from your Part Templates to match the item to a Part.</li>
      <li><b>Location</b>  - Use the name field (ex. "Land") of an existing Location to give the item a destination.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <b>Notes</b>  field is not required, but any text in this field will be added as a Note to the item's History. You may use
  this field for any notes you don't want to put in a Custom Field.</p>

  <h4>Step 3: Upload your completed CSV template</h4>

  <p>Use the form below to upload your filled out CSV sheet. After the document is uploaded, you'll be
  presented with a Preview table that will list any errors that need to be fixed, or give you the green light to complete the process.</p>
